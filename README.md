## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brette and I aspire to learn more about data science!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Pokedex Pokemon Mega Project. I am planning to do data science in all Pokemon from Gen 1 to Gen 9. I also plan create over 30 ML models to analyze Pokemon Data 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about more Un-Supervised Learning models such as Spectral Decomposition, Isolation Forests, and Auto-Encoders.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love board games. One of my favorite board games is Code Names!
