## Hi there 👋

My name is Brette and I aspire to learn more about data science!

- 🔭 I’m currently planning to make projects on financial data, exoplanet data, animal data, and more.
- 🌱 Check out my flagship project: The Pokemon Pokedex MEGA Project! This Project contains over 30 machine learning models on all Pokemon from Gen 1 to Gen 9!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love board games. One of my favorite board games is Code Names!
